# Assecor Coding Challenge

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.1.1.

## Up and running

Clone the project and then:

```bash
npm i
npm start
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Observations

* Both unit and e2e tests have been removed from the project.

* The Stars Wars API does not offer images so sample ones have been added to the project.

* Angular Material has been used to create the cards and the loading spinners.

* All SCSS is original. No CSS frameworks have beenn used to create the neither the interface nor the responsiveness.
